Let's focus on the meaning behind the data types we've chosen 6 of our columns contained binary numbers. These are the four columns representing the reason types education and prediction working with binary numbers means that we can have one of two values. As an example let's focus on prediction whether we see one or zero will show if an individual is expected to be excessively absent from work or not. The corresponding data type in my you well for these six columns is called B T the majority of the remaining values are integers. Which is why they are marked as end in our table columns containing such values are month value transportation expense age body mass index. Children and pets the only column we have not talked about is probability. Preferably it would contain floats the floating point data type values. This data type allows numbers to have a fractional part as well.
